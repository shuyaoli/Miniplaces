# Miniplaces Challenge

My attempt to a modified version of [Miniplaces Challenge](https://github.com/CSAILVision/miniplaces). Instead of making the top 5 guesses from 100 labels, it aims for the top 1 guess from 10 labels.

Use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to view IPython Notebooks if GitHub preview doesn't work.

Notebook "main.ipynb" is the main notebook used for training and validating models. Notebook "channel_statistics" is used to get RGB channels' mean and std, which are hardcoded in "main.ipynb" notebook for preprocessing the images.
